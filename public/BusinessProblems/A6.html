    <h3>How can we overcome issues people with disabilities may face when using webpages?</h3>

    <h5>

There are a variety of digital solutions available for people who have a disability which allow them to use webpages. Here is a list of the most common disabilities and the solutions available...
</br></br>

Low vision or partial sight:</br></br>
When interacting with websites people with low vision may typically need to do one or more of the following...
</br>    -	Adjust the size of the text on their browser
</br>    -	Use assistive software to magnify the web page
</br>    -	Override the style of web pages to use high contrast colour schemes
</br>    -	Use screen readers and/or braille display
</br></br>
The following features of web pages can make life difficult for people with low vision...
</br>    -	Fixed height text that cannot be resized
</br>    -	Semantically connected items that are some distance apart – eg form labels and input boxes too far apart
</br>    -	Insufficient colour contrast
</br>    -	Busy page backgrounds
</br>    -	Use of colour only to convey meaning
</br>    -	Dynamic updating of content some distance from focus
</br>


</br></br>

Blindness:</br></br>
People who are ‘legally blind’ may still have some slight vision or only the ability to tell light from dark. Typically blind users will have extreme difficulty using websites as sighted people would</br></br>
When interacting with websites people with blindness may typically need to do one or more of the following...
</br>    -  Use a screen reader
</br>    -  Use a braille display
</br></br>
The following features of web pages can make life difficult for people with blindness, so we can try to avoid these in order to better cater to blind people...
</br>    -  Images without appropriate alternate text
</br>    -  Badly or inappropriately marked up pages, forms etc
</br>    -  Poorly worded links
</br>    -  Pages with incorrect or non-unique titles
</br>    -  Pages without headings (See Using Headings Properly)
</br>    -  PDFs that are not created with accessibility in mind
</br>    -  AJAX updates of pages
</br>    -  Flash, Java and other RIA functionality
</br>
</br></br>


Hearing problems or deafness: </br></br>
Those who suffer from deafness shouldn’t have many problems with the internet. But of course the web is becoming an increasingly multimedia experience and those suffering with deafness are not well catered for.</br>

The following features of web pages can make life difficult for people with deafness...</br>
</br>    -	Video content with no captioning
</br>    -	Audio content or signals with no captioning
</br>    -	Background noises too loud
</br>    -	Very complex and/or obscure language
</br>
</br></br>

Epilepsy:</br></br>
Epileptic seizures can be triggered by flashing or strobe lights at certain frequencies. They can also be triggered by flickering or blinking content in web pages so it is important that websites do not present such content.
